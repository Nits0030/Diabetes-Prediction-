# Diabetes-Prediction-
   Prediction of diabetes based on the prevalent factors affecting it 
## Problem Statement: 
To study a Diabetes data set and build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether or not a person has Diabetes.

## Data Set Description: 
The given data set is from Kaggle contains more than 2k of observations of patients along with their health details. 

## Below is list of the predictor variables that will help us classify a patient as either Diabetic or Normal:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies so far
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)

The response variable or the output variable is:

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Data Analysis :
To build a Naive Bayes model in order to classify patients as either Diabetic or normal by studying their medical records such as Glucose level, age, BMI, etc.
